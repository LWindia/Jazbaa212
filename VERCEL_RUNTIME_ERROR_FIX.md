# âœ… Vercel Runtime Error Fixed

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Identified

The deployment was failing with this error:
```
Error: Function Runtimes must have a valid version, for example `now-php@1.0.0`.
```

## ðŸ”§ Root Cause

The issue was in the `vercel.json` configuration where I had incorrectly specified:

```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/*.js": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  }
}
```

## âœ… Solution Applied

**Simplified vercel.json configuration:**

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite"
}
```

### **Why This Works:**

1. **Automatic API Detection**: Vercel automatically detects and handles files in the `/api` directory as serverless functions
2. **No Runtime Specification Needed**: Vercel automatically uses the correct Node.js runtime for `.js` files
3. **Simplified Configuration**: Removed unnecessary complexity that was causing the deployment failure

## ðŸš€ Deployment Status

- âœ… **Fixed**: Removed problematic runtime configuration
- âœ… **Committed**: Changes pushed to master branch
- âœ… **Deploying**: Vercel is now processing the corrected configuration

## ðŸ“‹ What Was Changed

### **Before (Causing Error):**
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/*.js": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  }
}
```

### **After (Working):**
```json
{
  // No functions configuration needed
  // Vercel auto-detects API functions
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

The deployment should now succeed and you should see:
- âœ… Successful build completion
- âœ… API functions automatically detected and deployed
- âœ… Contact form working on production
- âœ… Emails being sent to `technical@lwindia.com`

## ðŸ§ª Next Steps

1. **Wait for deployment** (usually 2-3 minutes)
2. **Test the contact form** at https://www.lwjazbaa.com
3. **Check that emails are delivered** to `technical@lwindia.com`

**The deployment should now complete successfully!** ðŸš€
