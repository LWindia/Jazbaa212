# 🚨 URGENT: Syntax Error Fixed - Website Restored

## ⚡ Emergency Issue

Your live website deployment was failing with:
```
ERROR: Expected ";" but found "finally"
/vercel/path0/src/components/ContactFormModal.tsx:106:6
```

## 🔧 Root Cause

**Extra closing brace** in the try-catch-finally structure:

### **Before (Broken):**
```typescript
} catch (error) {
  // error handling...
}  // <- This extra closing brace was the problem
} finally {
  setIsSubmitting(false);
}
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```typescript
} catch (error) {
  // error handling...
} finally {
  setIsSubmitting(false);
}
```

## ✅ Solution Applied

**Removed the extra closing brace** that was breaking the try-catch-finally syntax structure.
